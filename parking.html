                <p align="center"><em>***Failure to complete these six steps will result in a denial of a parking permit.***</em></p>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>STEP 3: PLACE YOUR PERMIT ON THE WINDSHIELD</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    All permits should be permanently affixed (not temporarily taped) to the <u>front, lower corner of the passenger windshield</u>. Motorcyclists should affix the permit on the front windshield or fork. Only vehicles with an affixed Boyd parking decal will be allowed to park on campus. All other vehicles may be towed, ticketed, or booted at the student’s expense.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>STEP 4: ALWAYS PARK IN THE CORRECT AREA</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    Students must park in their designated parking area and ARE NOT allowed to park anywhere outside of their designated area. Each permit designates a specific area as listed below:
                </p>
                <p align="center"><strong><u>North Parking Lot Only</u></strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 20 senior parking spots that were auctioned to     juniors during second semester of last school year have been individually     marked with numbers and are only for the auctioned winners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Senior Permit     Areas-</strong> Exclusive, senior-only spots are     painted in YELLOW STRIPES and are nearest to the school. Students must have     a senior permit in order to park here. However, seniors may also park in     the underclassmen's white striped spots if a senior spot is unavailable.<strong></strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Underclassman Permit Area- </strong>Park in the designated WHITE STRIPED areas in the north     parking lot.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em> Note: During the second semester of the school year, all student permits are accepted in both north and south lots. Blue striped spots remain reserved for staff members, and yellow striped spots remain reserved for seniors.</em></p></td>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p align="center"><strong><u>South Parking Lot Only</u></strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>“B” Permit Area- </strong>Park in the WHITE STRIPED     areas in the south lot.<strong></strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Note: During the second semester of the school year, all student permits are accepted in both north and south lots. Blue striped spots remain reserved for staff members, and yellow striped spots remain reserved for seniors.</em></p></td>
                <br clear="ALL">

                <h4><strong>STEP 5: FOLLOW THE RULES TO AVOID CONSEQUENCES</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>      </strong>Students who violate the <a href="http://legacy.mckinneyisd.net/Campuses/school_websites/boyd/Information/Parking_Policies_and_Procedures_15-16.pdf">Parking Policies and Procedures</a>, park  in an unauthorized location, or park without a permit may be towed, ticketed, or booted at the student’s expense. If a student’s vehicle is booted, the student will pay a $25  removal fee and be required to purchase a parking permit if he/she has not  already done so. Finally, a student’s parking permit may be revoked and he/she  may lose the privilege of parking on campus not be permitted to purchase a  parking permit in the future. </p>
                <p><strong>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</strong><br>
                    <strong>Replacement permits. </strong>A replacement decal, except  for those that are lost or stolen, will cost $5. A portion of the old decal  MUST be presented at the time of purchasing a replacement. A replacement decal  for a lost or stolen decal is only replaced at full cost to the student.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Temporary permits. </strong>Students who were issued a parking permit but are temporarily driving a different vehicle may receive a temporary parking decal issued from C-202. A student must present his/her driver’s license in order to receive a temporary decal.</p>
                <p><strong>Drop-off and pick-up. </strong>All students who are dropped-off and/or picked-up from school must do so in FRONT of the school. For safety reasons, students will not be allowed to be picked-up or dropped-off in the north, south or back parking lots of the school.<br>
